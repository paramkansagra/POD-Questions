Number of Cells taken for Cell Division
A group of scientists are conducting an experimentation for six days on a particular type of cell ‘t’. These cells get the capability of cell division only when exposed to fresh air. The cells inside the test bed which have attained the capabilty of cell division divides into two every day morning by 5 am.

On a fine afternoon by 12:30 pm, the senior scientist of the group gives a test bed with one cell of type ‘t’, then the junior scientists collected ‘m’ cells of type ‘t’ and put them in the test bed. On the second day evening, one of the junior scientist opens the test bed and removes three cells from it. The test bed was left undisturbed for rest of the days. It was observed that ‘p’ cells were there inside the test bed on the evening of the sixth day. Given the number of cells in the test bed at the end of experimentation, write a C/C++ code to find the number of cells ‘m’ collected by the junior scientists.

For example, if 35 cells were in the test bed at the end of experimentation then the number of cells collected by junior scientist is 4.
