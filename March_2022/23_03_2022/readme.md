Distribution of Biscuit Packets

A charity wants to help the people in ‘m’ number of villages of a district that were badly affected by recent November floods. They have got some funds with them with which they would be able to get a maximum ‘n’ number of biscuit packets. A rich man in the city has told that he will also join the charity in helping the people with the following conditions:

(i) He will give biscuit packets before going to each village. If the charity has ‘p’ number of biscuit packets before going to a village then he will give ‘p’ more biscuit packets.

(iii) The charity should give equal number of biscuit packets to all the villages

(iv) No biscuit packets should be left over after the distribution process

Given the number of villages ‘m’, the maximum number of biscuit packets ‘n’ that can be bought with the money in the hands of the charity, write a C program to find the number of biscuit packets that should be bought so that maximum number of biscuit packets can be distributed to the villages and the number of biscuit packets that shall be distributed to each village.

For example, if the number of villages is 2, and the maximum number of biscuit packets that shall be bought with the money in the hands of charity is 10 then the charity shall buy 9 packets and distribute 12 packets to each village.
