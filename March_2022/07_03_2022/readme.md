Toggle Switch

There are ‘n’ light bulbs lined up in a row in a long room. Each bulb is numbered consecutively from 1 to ‘n’ and each bulb is independently connected to a switch which are currently in off state. ‘n’ people are lined up outside the entry door of the room. Every ‘ith’ person in the line enter the room and toggle the state of ‘ith’ switch and exit the room. Given the value of ‘n’ and an integer ‘m’, write a C program to find the state of ‘mth’ switch. Print ‘On’ if the switch will be in ‘On’ state print ‘Off’ otherwise. For example, if there are 10 switches then status of 5th switch will be Off after all ten people toggle the switches.
