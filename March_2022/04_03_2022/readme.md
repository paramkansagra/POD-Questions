Shuffled Rows Matrix

A matrix is said to be shuffled rows matrix if the elements in all the rows are same but may be in a shuffled order. Given nxm matrix, write a C program to check if the matrix is a Shuffled Rows Matrix. For example, a 3x4 matrix M as shown below is a Shuffled rows matrix:

4 5 1 7

7 1 4 5

1 7 5 4

Whereas the matrix M1 shown below is not a Shuffled row matrix

3 1 2

3 3 1

1 2 3

Boundary conditions

0<r,c<20

Input Format

First line contains the number of rows in the matrix, m

Next line contains the number of columns in the matrix, n

Next ‘m’ lines contain the elements in each row of the matrix separated by a space
