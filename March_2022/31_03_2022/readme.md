Identify Powers of Three

Given an integer n, write a C++ program to find m where m is maximum of (n, n-1, n-2) and m can be expressed as sum of power(3, k) where k>=1. For example, if n is 123 then m is 123 and it can be written as 81, 27, 9, 3, 3. If n is 257, then m is 255 and it can be written as 243, 9, 3.

Input Format

First line contains the number, n

Output Format

First line contains powers of 3 which would be used for writing m separated by a tab (Print Powers of 3 from higher to lower)

Next line contains the value of m that can be expressed as sum of power of 3
