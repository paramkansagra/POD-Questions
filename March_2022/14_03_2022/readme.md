Count Same Positions


Given an integer ‘n’, write a C program to count the number of digits that are in the same position after forming an integer ‘m’ with the digits in ‘n’ but in ascending order of digits. For example, if the value of ‘n’ is 351462987 then value of ‘m’ will be 123456789 and digits 4 and 8 will be in the same position.
