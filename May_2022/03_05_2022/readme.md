Arrange the Chocolates

A shopkeeper likes to promote logical thinking. So he gives discount for kids following a particular startegy when they buy even number of chocolates. He asks each kid to arrange the chocolates that they want to buy and the child has to pay the sum of difference of each pair of chocolates from the beginning. He gives a gift if the child arranges so that the kid has to pay the maximum cost.

For example, if the kid buys four chocolates with cost 2, 5, 3, 9. If the kid arranges the chocolate with costs as 2, 3, 5, 9 then the sum of difference of costs between a pair of chocolates is therefore the cost to be paid is 5 and if the arrangement is 2, 5, 3, 9 then the cost to be paid is 9. 9 is the maximum amount that could be paid.

Given the number of chocolates bought by the kid and cost of each chocolate, write a C++ program to arrange the chocolates so that the kid will get a gift.
