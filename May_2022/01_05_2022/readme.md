New Number System

A new k â€“ base number system using the symbols 0, 1, 2, ..., k-1 is developed. Each number in the k-base number system is separated by a comma. Let a1,a2,a3 be a number in k-base number system where ai f Îµ {0, 1, 2, ..., k-1} then value of the number in decimal number system is a3 * k2+a2 * k1+a1 * k0. In a 18-based number system, value of the number 16, 17, 15 is 15 * 182+17 * 181+15 * 180. Given two numbers in k-base number system, write a code to print the sum of the numbers in k-base system.

For example, if the two numbers n1 and n2 to base 9 are 6,8,7 and 7,8,0 then the sum of n1 and n2 are 4,8,8.

Input Format

First line contains the base of number system, k

Next line contains the number n1 in k-base number system

Next line contains the number n2 in k-base number system

Output Format

Print the sum of n1 and n2 in k-base number system
