Given a string ‘s’ with four different letters in it, write a C program to eliminate any of the two letters so that the string retained is valid and is of maximum possible length. All the of occurrences of the letters to be eliminated should be removed from s. The string retained after removing two letters is said to be valid when for all characters ‘ch’ in the string, either the character on its left or character on its right is same as ‘ch’. For example, aaddaaa is valid but aaaeaa is not valid.

When there are more than one valid string with the maximum possible length, retain the lexicographically lesser string. A string s1 is said to be lexicographically lesser than s2 when s1 will come first in dictionary. For example, consider the string s, aabbcddc with four different letters a, b, c and d. The valid strings that shall be formed with any two letters are:

aabb – When letters c and d are removed
aacc – When letters b and d are removed
aadd – When letters a and a are removed
bbcc – When letters a and d are removed
bbdd – When letters a and c are removed
cddc – When letters a and b are removed

The maximum length of the strings that can be formed is four and lexicographically least string is aabb, so print aabb.

Input Format

First line contains the string s with some four letters of English alphabet

Output Format

Lexicographically least and maximum length valid string retained after removing any two letters

Observations

First make a string by removing any 2 characters
Then check if it is valid or not
If valid then check it has the max length
If there are multiple elements with max length find the one which is minimum lexicographically
