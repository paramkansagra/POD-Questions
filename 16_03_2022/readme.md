Sides of a Rectangle

Given four points P1, P2, P3 and P4 check whether they can be corners of a rectangle with sides A, B, C and D respectively. The naming of the sides of the rectangle are shown as below.

For example, if P1 is (2, 12), P2 is (14, 12), P3 is (14, 22), P4 is (2, 22) then they can be corners A, B, C and D of a rectangle. Whereas the points P1 is (5, 12), P2 is (14, 12), P3 is (14, 22), P4 is (2, 22) cannot be corners of a rectangle. Distance between any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2) shall be calculated using the formula:

length = sqrt((x2-x1) ** 2 + (y2-y1) ** 2)

Print Yes if the points P1, P2, P3 and P4 can be corners A, B, C and D of a rectangle respectively and No otherwise.
