Secret Agent and Code Word

A secret agent is a government employee whose job involves gathering secret information about the governments of unfriendly foreign countries. A secret agent ‘X’ emailed a sentence ‘S’ with a code word ‘W’ to his head office. Only one word of the sentence 'S' is real and others are fake. The agent ‘X’ also mailed a sentence as a clue - if I tell you any one character ‘C’ of the code word 'W', then you would find exactly two words with ‘C’ in it, those words will have same number of vowels and one of them is ‘W’.

For example, if the senetence ‘S’ mailed by agent ‘X’ is "AIM DUE OAT TIE MOD", then TIE is the code word. Due to the following reasons:

If you were told any one character of MOD, then you would not be able to determine whether the number of vowels are one or two. e.g. if you were told M, there are two words with M - AIM with 2 vowels and MOD with 1 vowel. So you would not be able to say the number of vowels. Same arguments can be given for characters O and D. Hence, the word with any one of M, O or D is not a code word i.e. AIM, DUE, OAT and MOD are not the code word. Thus, TIE is the code word.
T : two words - TIE and OAT, both with 2 vowels
I : two words - TIE and AIM, both with 2 vowels
E : two words - TIE and DUE, both with 2 vowels.
