Number of Unique Points

Given ‘n’ integers which can be value of X or Y coordinate, write a C++ program to find the number of unique points that can be formed. For example given three values 1, 1 and 2 there can be four unique points (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1) and (2, 2) and when the three values given are 1, 2 and 3 there can be nine unique points (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2) and (3, 3). Given the value of ‘n’ integers, write a C++ program to find the number of unique points that can be formed with the given points.

Boundary Conditions

n can both positive and negative integers

Input Format

First line contains the value of n

Next line contains the ‘n’ integers separated by a space

Output Format

Print the number of unique points that can be formed
