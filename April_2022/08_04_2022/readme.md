Color of Building Blocks

There is a competition held among students of class six to build a given structure using building blocks. Blocks of ‘n’ different colors are given to the participants. One of the rule of the competition states that a block of a particular color can be chosen only after choosing ‘m’ other given colors where m≤n-1. Given the ‘n’ colors, the value of ‘m’ and the choice of colors made by the participants, write a C++ program to check if the choices made

For example given four color pink, yellow, blue and green represented by letters ‘p’, ‘y’, ‘b’ and ‘g’ and the value of m as two, it is valid to choose the colors in the sequence pbygpbygbpgypgbygp and the choice of color pbygygbpbygpbygbpgypgbygp is invalid for m=2.
