Check Money Taken by Child

A child wants to go to a chocolate expo and buy some chocolates. His father gives him a task and say that he will take the child to the expo provided he sucessfully does the task. The chocolate expo has variety of chocolates in all the prices which are natural numbers. The father gives a bowl of coins and tells the child that two rupees has to be spent as bus fare to reach the expo and he will buy four chocolates of same cost for him provided the child can pick coins that sum up to value with which they can reach the chocolate expo and buy exactly four chocolates of same cost and no money should be left out after purchasing the chocolates. For example, if the input is 110 (decimal value is 6) then print Sucess and if the string is 100 (decimal value is 4) then print Fail.

Given a string that gives binary representation of the money taken by the child, write a C++ code to check if the child has suceeded in the task or not.

Boundary Conditions

1 <= l <= 300, where l is the length of the binary string

Decimal value of the binary string > 0

Input Format

First line contains the binary representation of the amount taken by the child

Output Format

Print Success if the amount satifies the constraints of the father and print Fail otherwise
