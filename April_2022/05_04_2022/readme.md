Find the Five Numbers

Consider five numbers A, B, C, D and E where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D ≤ E, given the sum of all the possible two numbers combination in ascending order, write a C program to find the numbers A, B, C, D and E. That is if the sum of all the possible two numbers combination is 110, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, and 121. Then the numbers are 54, 56, 58, 59, 62.

Input Format

First line contains ten numbers separated by a space representing the sum of possible two number combinations in ascending order

Output Format

Print the values of A, B, C, D and E separated by a space
