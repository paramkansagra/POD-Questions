Plants Grown and Amount of Water

A farmer does drip irrigation in his field and every plant in his field would consume 1ml of water every alternate day. On a fine day, he plants ‘p’ plants and sows ‘s’ seeds in the field. The seeds are so special that they grow into plants two days. The farmer sows ‘s’ seed every alternate day. Given the number of plants he planted on the first day, the number of seeds he sows every alternate day and the value of ‘n’, write a C/ C++ program to find the number of plants that would be in his field on nth day and the total amount of water consumed by his plants. For example, if he plants four plants, sows five seeds every alternate day then on the third day, there will be totally 9 plants in his field and the total water consumed will be 13 ml and on the seventh day there will be 19 plants and total water consumed will be 46 ml.
