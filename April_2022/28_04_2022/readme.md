Longest Vertical Line

Given ‘n’ points, write a C++ code to find the longest vertical line that can be formed and the number of points to be used to form the line. Two points can be joined to form a vertical line if their x-coordinates are same and y-coordinates are different. Length of the line is defined as the distance between the start and end point of the line. For example, given seven points (2, 11), (2, 3), (7, 8), (2, 5), (5, 50), (5, 6) and (7, 3) the longest vertical line can be obtained by joining point (5, 6) and (5, 50) of length 44.

Input Format

First line contains the number of points, n

Next n lines contains the coordinates of the points x and y separated by a space

Output Format

First line should contain the starting point of the longest vertical line

Next line should contain the ending point of the longest vertical line

Next line should contain the length of the longest vertical line

Next line should contain the number of points used to form the longest vertical line
