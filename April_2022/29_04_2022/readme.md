Pair of Rabbits in Field 

A new born rabbit attains the capabilty to reproduce in two months and thereafter it reproduces every month. Here assume that a rabbit can reproduce a pair of rabbits every month, one of them is male and the other one is female and the rabbits never die. Then if there are initially ‘n’ pair of rabbits then

1. At the end of the first month there will be n pair of rabbits only

2. At the end of second month the female produces a new pair, so now there will be 2*n pairs of rabbits in the field.

3. At the end of the third month, the original ‘n’ female produces a second pair, making 3*n pairs in all in the field.

4. At the end of the fourth month, the original ‘n’ females has produced yet another ‘n’ pair, the females born two months ago produces their first pairs also, making 5*n pairs and so on

A farm owner has given some money to his worker to buy a maximum of ‘n’ pairs of rabbits and told that if they maintain the farm well so that no rabbits die and the pair of rabbits at the end of ‘m’ month is divisible by 3 then he will be rewarded.

The worker is confident to maintain the farm clean but doesn’t know how to select initial pair of rabbits so that he can be rewarded.

Write a C++ code to find the maximum initial number.

For example if the value of n is 8 and m is 20 then the output will be 8 and 54120.

Boundary Conditions m>=2

Input Format

First line contains the value of n Next line contains the value of m

Output Format 

Print the the number of pairs to be chosen initially and the number of pair of rabbits at the end of mth month separated by a space
