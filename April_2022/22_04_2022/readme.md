Find Number Up Side Down
A number plate was painted in a workshop and fixed in a house. But the person who fixed the plate made a mistake and fixed the board up side down. Luckily the numbers written on the plate are readable up side down also. It is a two digit number. For example if difference is 72 then the numbers are 08 and 80.

Given the difference between the original number and the number read upside down, write a C++ code to find the numbers
