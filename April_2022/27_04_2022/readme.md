Is Cattle Safe

A grazing field is in the shape of a rectangle. There is no physical fencing for the field. The field is bordered by yellow lines on all the four sides. If the cattle crosses the border on any side, the owner of the adjacent will hold the cattle as a captive. A farmer leaves his cattle inside the field in the morning and goes for his farm work. The farmer wants to develop a monitoring system so that farmer receives a beep alert in his mobile whenever the cattle is 1 cm nearer to the border on any side. The corners of the rectangle are designated as left-bottom, right-bottom, left-top, right-top. The left-bottom corner of the field is origin, in the 2-dimensional plane with x-axis and y-axis. All the coordinates of all the corners involve positive integers only. Breadth of the field is greater than the length of it. For example, if the diagonal of the field is 10 cm and the position of the cattle is (5, 3) then the cattle is in safe region.

Given the length of the diagonal of the field and the position of cattle (X,Y), write a code to identify whether the cattle is within a distance of 1 cm from the border on any side.
