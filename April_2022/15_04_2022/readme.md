Area Watered by Diesel Water Pump

A farmer uses diesel water pumps for irrigating his fields. The pumps start only when it is filled with ‘x’ litres of diesel and it can water ‘y’ acres of field. When the diesel level becomes one third of ‘x’ it stops working. Everyday the farmer gets ‘z’ litres of diesel. For example, if the value of x is 3, y is 2 and z is 12 then 10 acres can be irrigated at the maximum. Given the value of ‘x’ and ‘y’, write a C++ program to find out the maximum area that can be watered with ‘z’ litres of diesel.

Boundary Conditions

x, y, z are integers and z is a multiple of x

Input Format

First line contains the number of days, n

Next ‘n’ lines contains the value of x, y, z separated by a space

Output Format

In one line print the total acres that can be irrigated on everyday
