Packing Water Bottles for a Resort

There is a resort ‘ABC’ in a hill station, during season time many tourist come and stay in the resort. Everyday each resident of the resort is given a water bottle. From a mineral water plant, water bottles are packed in a cardboard box and sent to the resort. As per the bookings done, during first ‘m’ days the number of tourists staying in the resort gets increased and during the next ‘n’ days the number of tourists staying in the resort gets decreased. The resort places the order to the mineral water plant well in advance. There are two packaging machines M1 and M2 in the mineral water plant. M1 is used for packing when the number of bottles are multiple of 5 and M2 is used for packing all number of bottles. The working speed of M1 is much faster than M2 and both the machines pack the bottles faster when they are given number of bottles in ascending order. Given the number of guests for the first ‘m’ and subsequent ‘n’ days, write a C/C++ program to find the ordered list of number of bottles to be sent to M1 and M2 so that the packing can be done in minimum possible time.

For example, if the number of visitors for the first seven days is 12, 17, 20, 27, 29, 31, 35 and for the next six days the number of visitors in 30, 28, 25, 23, 16, 5 then the ordered list of bottles to be packed given for M1 is 5, 20, 25, 30, 35 and for M2 it is 12, 16, 17, 23, 27, 28, 29, 31.
