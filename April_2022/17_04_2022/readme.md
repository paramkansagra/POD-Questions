Arrange the Tiles

In a tile game a nXn grid of tiles with numbers are given to the players. In each move then can pluck a tile in a particular square and fix it on some other square. Given the numbers written on the tiles in current configuration and the numbers written on the tiles in desired configuration, write a C++ program to determine the minimum number of moves to be made by the player to attain the desired configuration from the current configuration. For example, if the numbers on a 3X3 tile (read row wise) is 23, 12, 45, 67, 53, 11, 13, 90, 75 and the desired cofiguration is 11, 12, 13, 23, 45, 53, 67, 75, 90 then 6 moves are required.

Input format

First line contains the number of tiles, nXn

Next line contains the numbers written on the tiles in the current configuration separated by a space

Next line contains the numbers written on the tiles in the desired configuration separated by a space

Output format

Print the minimum number of moves to be made to reach desired configuration from initial configuration
