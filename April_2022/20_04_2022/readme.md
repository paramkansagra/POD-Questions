Number of Connections in Mesh Topology
In a mesh topology, every computer is connected to every other computers in the network. Cost of connecting adajcent computers (c1) is less when compared to connecting non-adjacent computers (c2). Given the number of nodes in the network cost of connecting adjacent nodes and cost of connecting non-adjacent nodes, write a C++ code to compute the total cost involved in forming the mesh topology.

For example, if the number of nodes in the network is 5 and c1 is 7 and c2 is 8 then the total cost is 75.

Input Format

First line contains the number of nodes in the network, n

Next line contains the cost of connecting adjacent computer, c1

Next line contains the cost of connecting non-adjacent computer, c2

Output Format

Print the total cost incurred in building the mesh topology for the network
