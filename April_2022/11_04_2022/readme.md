Correctness of Printed Sheets

Number labels are to be prepared by a small scale printing company. The sheets are cut into uniform dimension and fed into the printing machine. The printing machine has to print some numbers in ascending order.

The printing machine doesnâ€™t do the job always correct it print numbers in wrong order sometimes. But some of the printed sheets are easily correctable by a single cut and a single paste. For example, if the printed sheet has numbers 17, 19, 23, 34, 56, 71, 80 then it has done the job correct. If the printed sheet has the numbers 76, 89, 91, 96, 23, 28, 29, 37, 45 then it is easily correctable since by a single cut after number 96 and single paste before 76 will contain the numbers in order that is cut after the 4th number in the printed sheet will do. If the printed sheets has the numbers 76, 89, 91, 96, 23, 28, 97, 29, 37, 45 is not easily correctable. Given the numbers in a printed sheet, write a C++ code to categorize it to Correct, Easily correctable or Not easilt correctable.
